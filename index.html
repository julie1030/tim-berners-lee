                Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955, London, England), British computer
                scientist,
                generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen
                Elizabeth
                II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish
                Technology
                Award Foundation.
                Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first
                commercial computer. (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from
                the
                University of Oxford, Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications
                Ltd.,
                located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry,
                including
                a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle
                physics
                laboratory in Geneva.
